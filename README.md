# OSCP&eCPPT
Moving all my notes from cherry tree to my git repo. 
While moving I will also be prepping for another run at my OSCP and elearn eCPPT. Goal is October. <br />
Prepping will start on Hack the Box, and Try Hack Me. Also planning on going through the TCM Practical Ethical Hacking course. Once I get closer to October ill move to the OSCP labs and course since they redid the course and content for 2023.
